# Analyzing Achievement Gaps in North Carolina

In this project, 2 freshmen at Duke University  expanded upon Dr. Roslyn Mickelson’s work in _The Cumulative
Disadvantages of First- and Second-Generation Segregation for Middle School Achievement_,
which found that a student attending a school with a racial imbalance towards a Black population is more likely to be placed in a lower academic ‘track’, which Charlotte schools used to
categorize students based on grade level proficiency.

Our research question is: how do the white students, students
of color, economically disadvantaged students, students with limited English proficiency, and
students with disabilities affect grade level proficiency of a North Carolina public school?
